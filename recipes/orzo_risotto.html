    <h1>Orzo Risotto</h1>
    <img src="../images/Risotto.webp">
    <p>I thought I had Arborio rice but I obviously did not. 
        Orzo pasta makes<br>
        a delightful risotto with help from spring veggies like asparagus and peas.<br>
        For service,
        garnish with some freshly grated Grana Padano cheese and chopped parsley.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups vegetarian chicken-flavored broth</li>
        <li>2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ medium yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise and sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked orzo pasta</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour vegetarian chicken broth and vegetable broth into a medium saucepan<br>
            over over medium heat; bring to a boil.
             Reduce heat to simmer and cover until needed.</li>
        <li>Melt butter and oil together in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onion,<br>
            pepper flakes, and a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cook and stir for about 4<br>
            minutes before adding the zucchini and another pinch of sea salt. Stir and<br>
            continue to cook for about 3 minutes. Next, stir in the dry orzo pasta and<br>
            continue to cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in wine, stirring as it bubbles until the rapid bubbling stops. Pour in hot<br>
            broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat slightly and add cheese rind and 1/2<br>
            teaspoon sea salt. Cook and stir until a good portion of the liquid has been<br>
            soaked up by the orzo, about 10 minutes. Stir in asparagus and frozen peas and<br>
            continue to simmer until nearly all of the liquid is gone and orzo is fully cooked,<br>
            about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in Grana Padano cheese, parsley, lemon zest and juice, and desired amount<br>
            of cracked pepper. Remove and discard cheese rind. Taste and adjust salt and<br>
            pepper as desired.</li>
    </ol>
